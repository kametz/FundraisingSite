    <h2>About Gifti</h2>
    <p>Gifti is a prototyping project for a simplified charitable giving website.  In the interest of creating this project
     in a limited time frame, Gifti lacks
     features that would otherwise be vital to such a project, but I hope it provides a pleasant user experience in the scope of what
     it does do.  </p>
    <p>Gifti was created with the help of Sass, Bourbon, Foundation CSS, a pinch of Skeleton CSS, FlexSlider (image slider), jQuery, 
    HTML, CSS, and a lot of time spent with Google and Stack Overflow.  </p>
    <p>With the exception of the frameworks and plugins listed above,
      all prototyping, branding, wireframing, programming, etc. was
      completed by me.</p>
